Frontend
  x User inputs "information" into a web form
  x Form data is submitted to backend
  Form data is validated
  x User receives confirmation on frontend
    Display of "normalized output" [person, time, and location (latitude and longitude)]


Backend
  x Receives form data from frontend
  x Makes API call to geonames.org
  OR processes info internally to determine location
  x Saves "normalized output" to database
  x Returns that output to frontend as JSON to display

Breakdown:
  x add db w/ tables
  x add routes for db info
    'create' route to include API call
    'create' route should take in staff_member email
  x generate dummy data

  x build frontend form
    fields:
      email
      location
      country? (to aid lookup)

  add validation / error handling

Do I need to deal with timezones for timestamps?
  timestamps are in UTC, could show back to user in local time
  
Do I want to build a separate frontend or use Rails fullstack?
  probably fullstack for prototyping

Fuzzy matching w/ API or exact?
